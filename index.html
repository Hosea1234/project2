            <h1>What's GitHub?</h1>
            GitHub is a platform for hosting, storing, and editing code. Individuals use it to host small websites, organize projects, and collaborate with teammates and community members. The platform is built around "Repositories" used to organize code for single projects.
            
            Organizations use GitHub to share code and collaborate on projects internally, or to publicly post open source projects.
            
            Individuals and organization members alike benefit from GitHub's massive community of creators. GitHub creators borrow inspiration and ideas from one another and help each other to solve problems.
            
            GitHub even has a sponsorship program so that funders that find open source projects that they are passionate about can contribute to the individual or organization behind it.</p>
         
            <h1>Brief history and background of GitHub</h1>
               <p>Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett founded GitHub in 2008. It quickly grew in popularity as a platform for hosting and sharing Git-based code repositories. The founders wanted to create a platform that made it easy for developers to collaborate on code and share their work with the world.
                
                GitHub's combination of useful features made it a huge success. It grew so quickly that Microsoft decided to buy it in 2018 for $7.5 billion, making it one of the year's largest deals. This acquisition demonstrated both Microsoft's dedication to open-source software and GitHub's prominence in the world of software development.
                
                Overall, GitHub has an intriguing history and has played an essential role in the growth and development of the open-source software community. It's no wonder GitHub is such a vital resource for developers around the world.</p>
